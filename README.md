# Consuming-APIs
### Overview

* In this assignment, I used the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with  gifs of your choice. To finish this task, I call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of the page.

* This app takes the topic a user selects, and adds it to my array of search options. All items in this array are appended to the page as buttons using a loop.

3. When the user clicks on a button, the page calls GIPHY's API to search for the gifs using the button's value, and the chosen rating. The page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page.

4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif animates by changing it's URL to an animated URL. If the user clicks the gif again, it will change back to a still image, and vice versa.

5. Under every gif that is loaded, I display the rating GIPHY gives the gif.
